= JSON5 Endorsement
:description: Formal endorsement and specification for using JSON5 in Dev Center projects.

JSON5 is a superset of JSON that expands its syntax to include some features from ECMAScript 5.1. It is designed to be easier for humans to write and maintain by hand.

== Rationale

Standard JSON is often too restrictive for configuration files. It lacks support for:

* **Comments**: Explaining why a specific configuration value is set.
* **Trailing Commas**: Reducing diff noise when adding new items to lists or objects.
* **Unquoted Keys**: Reducing visual clutter.
* **Multi-line Strings**: For long descriptions or embedded content.

By endorsing JSON5, we improve the developer experience and maintainability of our configuration files.

== Specification

All projects within `the-dev-center` organization should prefer JSON5 for:

1.  **Configuration Files**: User settings, build configurations, and metadata.
2.  **Static Data**: Localized strings, mock data, and schemas.
3.  **Templates**: Repository templates and boilerplate configurations.

=== File Extensions

The preferred file extension is `.json5`. In cases where a tool strictly requires `.json` but supports JSON5 features (like VS Code's `settings.json`), the extension may remain `.json` or `.jsonc`.

=== Formatting Rules

* Use 2-space indentation.
* Include trailing commas for multi-line objects and arrays.
* Use single or double quotes for strings as appropriate, but be consistent within a file.
* Prefer unquoted keys unless the key contains special characters.

== Implementation in D-lang

For D-lang projects, we use the internal `json5-d` library (to be implemented) which provides a native, high-performance JSON5 parser and serializer compatible with `std.json`.
