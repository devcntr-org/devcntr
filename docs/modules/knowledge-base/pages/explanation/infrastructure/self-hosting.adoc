= Self-Hosting Git Infrastructure

Hosting your own Git infrastructure provides complete control over your source code, data privacy, and integration workflows. For small teams or personal use, lightweight solutions often provide the best balance of features and resource usage.

== Gitea: The Lightweight Powerhouse

link:https://gitea.com/[Gitea] is an community-managed fork of Gogs, designed to be a "painless self-hosted Git service." It is written in Go and can run on anything from a Raspberry Pi to a cluster.

=== Why Choose Gitea?

* **Performance:** Extremely low resource footprint (runs comfortably on 512MB RAM).
* **Feature Complete:** Includes issue tracking, pull requests, wiki, and a built-in CI/CD system (Gitea Actions).
* **Cross-Platform:** Single binary deployment for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Docker.
* **Extensibility:** Robust API and a dedicated CLI tool called **tea**.

=== Interaction via `tea` CLI

The link:https://gitea.com/gitea/tea[`tea`] CLI allows you to interact with your Gitea instance directly from the terminal.

* **Manage Issues**: List, create, and close issues without leaving the shell.
* **Review PRs**: List and approve pull requests.
* **Repository Management**: Create and configure repositories remotely.

== Other Self-Hosting Options

While Gitea is our primary recommendation for lightweight needs, other options exist:

* **GitLab Community Edition (CE)**: The industry standard for enterprise-grade self-hosting. Requires significant resources (4GB+ RAM recommended).
* **Forgejo**: A "soft-fork" of Gitea focused on being "liberated" and community-driven, following Gitea's move to a more corporate structure.
* **SourceHut**: A minimalist, "no-JS" forge focused on email-driven workflows and speed.
