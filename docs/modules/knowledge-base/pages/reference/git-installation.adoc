= Git Installation & Package Selection

A clean Git installation is the foundation of a stable development environment. On Windows, several overlapping packages exist in the `winget` ecosystem, which can lead to path conflicts and configuration errors if mixed incorrectly.

== Recommended Installation

For most developers, the standard community-maintained package is the only one required.

[source,powershell]
----
winget install Git.Git
----

This package includes the standard Git binaries, Bash emulation, and the modern **Git Credential Manager (GCM)**.

== Packages to Avoid

To maintain a stable environment, we strictly advise against installing the following packages on top of or instead of `Git.Git`.

=== Do Not Install `Git.GCM` (Standalone)

The standalone `Git.GCM` (Git Credential Manager) package was previously used to provide secure authentication. However, GCM is now bundled directly with `Git.Git`.

**Why it causes issues:**

* **Environment Pollution:** Installing the standalone package adds redundant binaries to your `PATH`, often leading to version mismatches.
* **Configuration Conflicts:** Both packages attempt to manage the standard `credential.helper` setting, which can cause authentication to fail silently or result in "helper not found" errors.

=== Avoid `Microsoft.Git`

While it may seem official, the `Microsoft.Git` package should not be used for general development.

**Why it causes issues:**

* **Path Inconsistency:** It often uses non-standard installation paths compared to the community-maintained `Git.Git`, which can break automation scripts and terminal integrations.
* **Update Lag:** This package frequently trails behind the primary Git for Windows releases, leaving developers without the latest security patches or features.
* **Component Bloat:** It may include specialized components intended for Visual Studio's internal Git support that conflict with global shell configurations.

== Optional: Git SDK for Contributors

If you intend to contribute directly to the source code of **Git for Windows** itself, you should install the **Git SDK**.

[source,powershell]
----
winget install Git.SDK
----

[CAUTION]
====
The Git SDK is a complete development environment (including a compiler, libraries, and build tools) specifically for building Git from source. It is extremely large and **not recommended** for general application development. Use `Git.Git` unless you are specifically working on the Git project.
