==== Spotlight: SourceGit

The link:https://github.com/love-linger/sourcegit[SourceGit] project is a modern, cross-platform client with an exceptionally active release cycle (Feb 2026 v2026.04).

**Technical Considerations:**

* **Framework:** Built on **AvaloniaUI** and **.NET 10**. Requires specific runtimes and may exhibit minor UI glitches (scrollbar overlaps, pixel-perfect rendering) due to its "bleeding-edge" tech stack.
* **Environment:** Explicitly requires **Git for Windows** (does not support MSYS Git).
* **Platforms:** macOS users may need to use `xattr` to bypass security restrictions, though it is now available via signed Homebrew Cask packages.
* **Submodules:** Recent versions (v2026.04) have improved automation but users report worktree file statuses may not update correctly after pull/checkout operations.

**Workflow & UX Limitations:**

* **Built-in Merger:** Features a simple merger (added late 2025) but lacks the depth of dedicated 3-way merge tools like Beyond Compare.
* **Config Stability:** Recent updates shifted settings like "Show Tags/Submodules as Tree" from global to per-repository, which may be jarring.
* **Performance:** Recently optimized for large repos by switching to `--pathspec-from-file`, but still faces scaling challenges.

**Activity Summary:**

* **AI Integration:** Support for OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.
* **Graphics Support:** Fixes for `.dds` and `.tga` alpha rendering in diff views.
* **Release Cycle:** Follows a "Year.Month" scheme with multiple updates per month.
