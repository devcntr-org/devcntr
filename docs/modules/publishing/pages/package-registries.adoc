= Package Registries: Where to Publish?
:navtitle: Package Registries

Once you have a release, where should you publish it? The answer depends on your language and target audience.

== The "GitHub Packages" Misconception

GitHub Packages supports specific ecosystems: **npm, NuGet, Maven, Gradle, RubyGems, and Docker**.

**It does not verify "generic" software.**

For a D language project like `msi-generator`:
*   **Is it advisable to publish to GitHub Packages (npm/NuGet)?**
    *   **No.** It would require wrapping your native binary in a NodeJS or .NET generic wrapper. This adds complexity for no benefit unless your primary users are strictly JS/.NET developers.
*   **Is there an exception?**
    *   **Docker (ghcr.io)**: Publishing a container image to GitHub Container Registry is excellent.
    *   **Why?** It makes your tool "language agnostic". A Python, Rust, or Java project can use your tool in their detailed CI pipeline without installing a D compiler or dealing with system dependencies.
    *   **Example**:
        `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src ghcr.io/the-dev-center/msi-generator:latest`

| Registry | Purpose | Verdict

| **code.dlang.org**
| The official D package registry.
| **Essential. Do this first.** Enables `dub fetch msi-generator`.

| **Winget**
| Windows Package Manager.
| **Highly Recommended.** Best way for Windows users to install CLI tools.

| **Chocolatey**
| Legacy Windows Package Manager.
| **Optional.** Good if you have enterprise users on older systems.

| **Homebrew**
| macOS Package Manager.
| **Recommended** if you support macOS users.

| **GitHub Releases**
| Raw binaries.
| **Essential.** This is your source of truth. All other managers (Winget, Brew) just point to these URLs.

== Summary

1.  **Binaries**: Use GitHub Releases (Done).
2.  **Library**: Use code.dlang.org (Do this next).
3.  **Containers**: Use GitHub Packages (Container Registry) if you need CI portability.
4.  **Skip**: npm, Nuget, Maven packages.
