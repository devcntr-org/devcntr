= Git Release Workflow: When to Publish?
:navtitle: Git Release Workflow

Deciding when to transition from "development" to "production" can be confusing. This guide clarifies the process and importance of formal releases.

== The "Alpha/Beta" Myth

You often **do not need** to go through a formal "Alpha" or "Beta" label process unless you are coordinating a large public testing phase.

If your software is functional and you want it to be usable by others (or your future self) reliably, you simply need a **stable reference point**.

== Why Create a Release?

1.  **Stability**: A Git tag (e.g., `v0.1.0`) locks the code to a specific commit. This ensures that even if you break `main` later, your production builds won't suddenly fail because they are pinned to a known good version.
2.  **Discoverability**: Creating a Release on GitHub allows you to attach **compiled binaries** (e.g., `.exe`, `.deb`). This is crucial for users who just want to *run* the tool without installing a compiler or build system.
3.  **Package Management**: Most package managers (DUB, Cargo, npm) rely on Git tags for versioning. Registering your package often requires a valid semantic version tag (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

== The Workflow

=== 1. Prepare the Codebase
Ensure your documentation is up-to-date and any production-specific configurations are set.

*   Update `README.adoc` with usage instructions.
*   Ensure default launch configurations are sensible.
*   Run final tests.

=== 2. Commit and Tag
Once you are confident in the state of the code:

[source,bash]
----
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Prepare for v0.1.0 release"
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin main --tags
----

=== 3. Create Release on GitHub
1.  Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2.  Click **Releases** -> **Draft a new release**.
3.  Select the tag you just pushed (`v0.1.0`).
4.  Add a title and description of changes.
5.  **Important**: Upload any compiled binaries (artifacts) here. This makes your tool immediately useful to non-developers.

== Production Readiness Types

*   **Source Ready**: The code is tagged. Users can clone via tag or use it as a library dependency.
*   **Binary Ready**: Binaries are attached to the release. Users can download and run immediately.
*   **Registry Ready**: The package is published to a language-specific registry (npm, code.dlang.org, crates.io). Users can install via standard package managers.

Start with **Source Ready** (Tagging). Move to **Binary Ready** if you have a CLI tool. Go to **Registry Ready** only when you want wider community adoption.
