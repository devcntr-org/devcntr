DEV CENTER SOURCE CODE AND BRANDING LICENSE

Copyright (c) The Dev Center Project (https://github.com/the-dev-center/dev-center).
All rights reserved.

This license governs your use of the Dev Center software, documentation, and
related materials ("Software") in this repository. Most of the Software is
licensed for open use under the terms below; branding and certain uses are
restricted.

================================================================================
1. DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

"Software" means source code, documentation, configuration, and other
materials in this repository, except Branding.

"Branding" means the names "Dev Center", "the-dev-center", "The Dev Center",
and any variant that suggests official or endorsed origin; all logos, icons,
splash screens, and visual identity; and any trade dress that would cause
confusion with the official Dev Center product. Branding is NOT licensed under
this document. Use of Branding requires separate written permission from the
copyright holder.

"Prohibited Distribution" means any distribution of the Software (or a
derivative) that:

  (a) is a frivolous or duplicate listing in an app store, marketplace, or
      similar distribution channel that adds no substantial value (e.g., a
      near-identical copy with no meaningful improvement or differentiation);

  (b) is malicious (e.g., contains malware, steals data, or harms users); or

  (c) is cognitively or commercially abusive, including but not limited to:
      stuffing the product with ads, dark patterns, or monetization that
      exploits users or the reputation of this project without adding
      commensurate value.

================================================================================
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS (SOURCE CODE)
================================================================================

Subject to the conditions and restrictions in this license, you are granted a
worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:

  * use the Software;
  * modify the Software;
  * distribute source code and binaries of the Software or your modifications,
    provided you do not engage in any Prohibited Distribution and you comply
    with the Branding restrictions in Section 3.

You must retain this license and any copyright notices. Distribution of
modified Software must be under this same license (or a later version the
copyright holder may designate), with clear indication of your changes.

================================================================================
3. BRANDING — RESERVED RIGHTS
================================================================================

No right is granted to use Branding. You may not use the names, logos, or
trade dress of Dev Center to imply endorsement, official status, or origin
from the copyright holder unless you have separate written permission. Forked
or derivative products must not present themselves as "Dev Center" or as
official or endorsed versions without such permission.

================================================================================
4. PROHIBITED DISTRIBUTIONS AND PENALTIES
================================================================================

4.1 Prohibition. You may not create, publish, or maintain any Prohibited
Distribution. Doing so constitutes a material breach of this license and
violation of the copyright holder's rights.

4.2 Consequences of breach.

  (a) All rights granted under this license terminate automatically, worldwide,
      as to you and any entity you control or that distributes the Prohibited
      Distribution with your knowledge or participation.

  (b) You agree that actual damages for a Prohibited Distribution are difficult
      to ascertain and that the following amounts are reasonable estimates of
      harm and not penalties: (i) liquidated damages of fifty thousand United
      States dollars (USD 50,000) per distinct Prohibited Distribution (e.g.,
      per app store listing or per distinct product), and (ii) an additional
      fifty thousand United States dollars (USD 50,000) if the Prohibited
      Distribution is malicious or cognitively abusive as described in
      Section 1(c). The copyright holder may seek these amounts in addition to
      any other remedies.

  (c) The copyright holder is entitled to seek injunctive relief (including
      removal of listings and cessation of distribution) without proof of
      monetary harm.

  (d) In any action to enforce this license or redress a Prohibited
      Distribution, the prevailing party may recover reasonable attorneys'
      fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.

4.3 The remedies in this Section 4 are cumulative and not exclusive of any
other remedies at law or in equity.

================================================================================
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
================================================================================

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

================================================================================
6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
================================================================================

EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTIONS 3 OR 4 (BRANDING AND PROHIBITED DISTRIBUTIONS),
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

================================================================================
7. GENERAL
================================================================================

This license constitutes the entire agreement regarding the Software. If any
provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
Failure to enforce any term does not waive that term. You may not assign your
rights under this license without the copyright holder's prior written consent.
The copyright holder may publish updated versions of this license; use of the
Software after publication constitutes acceptance of the new terms for new
use or distribution.
