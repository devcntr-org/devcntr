SUMMARY — "I AM GOD"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original repository (devcntr-org/devcntr) is the canonical source.
Respect it as such. In short:

  * YOU MAY: Use, modify, and run the Software. Make and sell your own
    software (but not by incorporating this Software into it). Fork and
    contribute back. Distribute the Software or your modified version under
    this license. Distribute the Software's binaries together with a
    platform it runs on (e.g., an OS or runtime image). Build plugins that
    run with DevCntr (without bundling DevCntr with your plugin).

  * YOU MAY NOT: Pretend your fork or product is the official DevCntr or
    run a competing "DevCntr" company without permission. Bundle this
    Software into your own product or ship it inside your app's installer as
    a value-added tool. Use the DevCntr name or branding without
    permission. Do abusive or malicious things with the Software (see full
    terms below).

The full license below is what governs your rights and obligations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This license makes the DevCntr software source-available: you may view,
use, and modify the Software under the terms below. Commercial use is
permitted (e.g., you may make and sell your own software), but you may not
incorporate the Software into your own product (see below). You may
distribute binaries of the Software together with a platform the Software
runs on (e.g., an OS image or runtime distribution). You may not bundle the
Software as a value-added side-tool for your product—for example, you may
not ship the Software inside another application's installer on the same
platform the Software runs on. Plugins, extensions, or add-ons that work with
DevCntr may use the Software in the ordinary way (your plugin runs with
DevCntr; you do not bundle DevCntr with your plugin). You may not
offer a competing product or business that substitutes for the official Dev
Center project without separate written permission. Branding and certain
distributions remain restricted.

================================================================================
1. DEFINITIONS
================================================================================

"Software" means source code, documentation, configuration, and other
materials in this repository, except Branding.

"Branding" means the names "DevCntr", "devcntr-org", "The DevCntr",
and any variant that suggests official or endorsed origin; all logos, icons,
splash screens, and visual identity; and any trade dress that would cause
confusion with the official DevCntr product. Branding is NOT licensed under
this document. Use of Branding requires separate written permission from the
copyright holder.

"Competing Use" means using the Software or any derivative (including forks)
to operate, offer, market, or promote a product, service, or business that
competes with or substitutes for the official DevCntr project—for example,
offering your own "DevCntr" company, a near-identical fork as a product or
service, or a paid alternative that replaces DevCntr. Competing Use
requires prior written permission from the copyright holder and is not
granted under this license.

"Incorporation" means distributing, bundling, embedding, or otherwise
including the Software (or a derivative) as part of your own product or
software, so that your product ships with or is built on the Software as a
component—for example, shipping the Software inside another application's
installer on the same platform the Software runs on, as a value-added or
bundled side-tool. You may not incorporate the Software into your product.
Incorporation does not include: (a) distributing binaries of the Software
together with a platform the Software runs on (e.g., an operating system,
runtime, or distribution image); or (b) developing or distributing a plugin,
extension, or add-on that is designed to work with DevCntr and that is
used in the ordinary way (the user runs DevCntr separately; your plugin
runs with or within DevCntr; you do not distribute the Software as part
of your plugin). Incorporation is not granted under this license.

"Prohibited Distribution" means any distribution of the Software (or a
derivative) that:

  (a) is a frivolous or duplicate listing in an app store, marketplace, or
      similar distribution channel that adds no substantial value (e.g., a
      near-identical copy with no meaningful improvement or differentiation);

  (b) is malicious (e.g., contains malware, steals data, or harms users); or

  (c) is cognitively or commercially abusive, including but not limited to:
      stuffing the product with ads, dark patterns, or monetization that
      exploits users or the reputation of this project without adding
      commensurate value.

================================================================================
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS (SOURCE CODE)
================================================================================

Subject to the conditions and restrictions in this license, you are granted a
worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, source-available license to:

  * use the Software for any purpose, including commercial use, subject to
    the restrictions in Section 3 (no Incorporation into your product; no
    Competing Use; plugins that work with DevCntr may use the Software in
    the ordinary way);
  * modify the Software;
  * distribute source code and binaries of the Software or your modifications,
    provided you do not engage in Incorporation (Section 3.1), do not engage
    in Competing Use (Section 3.2), do not engage in any Prohibited
    Distribution, and you comply with the Branding restrictions in
    Section 3.3.

This license does not grant any right to Incorporation or Competing Use. You must retain this
license and any copyright notices. Distribution of modified Software must be
under this same license (or a later version the copyright holder may
designate), with clear indication of your changes.

================================================================================
3. RESERVED RIGHTS: NO INCORPORATION; NO COMPETING USE; BRANDING
================================================================================

3.1 No Incorporation. No right is granted to incorporate the Software (or any
derivative) into your own product or software. You may not bundle the
Software as a value-added side-tool for your product—for example, you may
not ship the Software inside another application's installer on the same
platform the Software runs on. You may not otherwise embed, ship, or attach
the Software to your product so that your product includes or is built on the
Software as a component. This prohibition does not apply to: (a) distributing
binaries of the Software together with a platform the Software runs on (e.g.,
an OS image, runtime, or distribution); or (b) plugins, extensions, or
add-ons that work with DevCntr in the ordinary way (the user runs Dev
Center separately; your plugin runs with or within DevCntr; you do not
distribute the Software as part of your plugin). Incorporation requires
prior written permission from the copyright holder.

3.2 No Competing Use. No right is granted to use the Software or any
derivative (including forks) to run, offer, or promote a company, product, or
service that competes with or substitutes for the official DevCntr
project (e.g., your own "DevCntr" or a near-identical alternative).
Competing Use requires prior written permission from the copyright holder.

3.3 Branding. No right is granted to use Branding. You may not use the names,
logos, or trade dress of DevCntr to imply endorsement, official status, or
origin from the copyright holder unless you have separate written permission.
Forked or derivative products must not present themselves as "DevCntr" or
as official or endorsed versions without such permission.

================================================================================
4. PROHIBITED CONDUCT AND PENALTIES
================================================================================

4.1 Prohibition. You may not (a) create, publish, or maintain any Prohibited
Distribution, (b) engage in Incorporation, or (c) engage in Competing Use.
Doing any of the foregoing constitutes a material breach of this license and
violation of the copyright holder's rights.

4.2 Consequences of breach.

  (a) All rights granted under this license terminate automatically, worldwide,
      as to you and any entity you control or that engages in the breach (e.g.,
      Prohibited Distribution, Incorporation, or Competing Use) with your
      knowledge or participation.

  (b) You agree that actual damages for a Prohibited Distribution,
      Incorporation, or Competing Use are difficult to ascertain and that the
      following amounts are reasonable estimates of harm and not penalties:
      (i) liquidated damages of fifty thousand United States dollars (USD
      50,000) per distinct Prohibited Distribution, per distinct instance of
      Incorporation, or per distinct instance of Competing Use (e.g., per app
      store listing, per product that incorporates the Software, or per
      competing offering or business), and (ii) an additional
      fifty thousand United States dollars (USD 50,000) if the Prohibited
      Distribution is malicious or cognitively abusive as described in
      Section 1(c). The copyright holder may seek these amounts in addition to
      any other remedies.

  (c) The copyright holder is entitled to seek injunctive relief (including
      removal of listings, cessation of distribution, cessation of
      Incorporation, and cessation of Competing Use) without proof of monetary
      harm.

  (d) In any action to enforce this license or redress a Prohibited
      Distribution, Incorporation, or Competing Use, the prevailing party may
      recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs from the non-prevailing party.

4.3 The remedies in this Section 4 are cumulative and not exclusive of any
other remedies at law or in equity.

================================================================================
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
================================================================================

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,
OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE
SOFTWARE.

================================================================================
6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
================================================================================

EXCEPT FOR BREACH OF SECTIONS 3 OR 4 (BRANDING AND PROHIBITED DISTRIBUTIONS),
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR AUTHORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR
PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE,
EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

================================================================================
7. GENERAL
================================================================================

This license constitutes the entire agreement regarding the Software. If any
provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
Failure to enforce any term does not waive that term. You may not assign your
rights under this license without the copyright holder's prior written consent.
The copyright holder may publish updated versions of this license; use of the
Software after publication constitutes acceptance of the new terms for new
use or distribution.
